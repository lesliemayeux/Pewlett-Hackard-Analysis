# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Pewlett Hackard's HR department is needing helping determining the number of employees that are eligible for retirement.  Along with that, we need to outline in which departments these employees work and which ones are eligible for the companies mentorship program.


## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
- 90,398 of the companies 300,024 employees are eligible for retirement (30.13%).
- The departments with the highest number of possible employees retiring are development (25.45%) and production (22.30%).
- Engineers are the highest percentage of employees eligible for retirement at 48.47%.
- A total of 1,549 employees qualify for the mentorship program.


## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
### - How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
If everyone retires, they are going to have to fill 90,398 employees unless some of them stay in the mentorship program
